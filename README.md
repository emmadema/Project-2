# Project 2 - My Closet

My app is meant to solve the problem: What do I wear today? The app allows you to upload clothing form your closet and helps you select outfits to organize into a calandar.

## Solving a Problem:

	*Problem: I spend too much time selecting outfits for each day.

	* Goal: Make an app that takes the clothing from your closet and searches through 			Shopify and a weather API to get recommended outfits each day

	* What am I making?
		* An outfit planning app

	* Why am I making it in the first place?
		* To help save time when deciding what to wear each day

	* Why would people use it?
		* As a time saver

	* What kind of people will use it?
		*This app will be heard toward working females.

	*How do I make it the best resource for them?
		* Allow people to pull in clothing from Shopify so they donâ€™t have to add as 			much manually
		* Allow the app to be visually pleasing and easy to use
		* Make the app a mobile app for ease of use in the go
		* Allow new clothing to be added  by scanning the barcode 

	* Who would need this? 
		* Young professional women who love fashion, but need to save time
