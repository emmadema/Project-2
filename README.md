# Project 2 - My Closet

My app is meant to solve the problem: What do I wear today? The app allows you to upload clothing form your closet and helps you select outfits to organize into a calandar.

##Getting Started

[Deploy on Heroku](https://thawing-caverns-98263.herokuapp.com)

## Solving a Problem:
	* Problem: I spend a lot of time picking an outift each day and for special events. A major issue is knowing the weather when I am sleceting an outfit. Also know what is in my closet.

	* Goal: I would like to make an app that can intergrate with shopify and weather.com
		* The app will list out the day of the week and the weather of the day (ideally you can sleste special event days from a calandar and it will pull up the weather for those days)
		* You will have to upload the clothes you already have and then push them into an API where you can delete or edit those clothes.
		* You can then go through the days of the week and add an outfit to each day - ideally this will have pictures (maybe allow uploading of your own pics or pull from shopify)

	* What am I making?
		* An outfit palnning app

	* Why am I making it in the first place?
		* To help save time and firstrationg when decding what to wear in the morning or before an event.

	* Why would people use it?
		*

	* What kind of people will use it?
		* I will be gearing it towards young working females who love fashion
		* This app will help busy females stay sylish witout breaking their schdule or making them late to start their day.

	*How do I make it the best resource for them?
		* Allow people to intergrate all of their own clothing with drop down menu options to reduce typing
		* also allow people to get outfit planning ideas from Shopify
		* pullclothes in from shopify as well to reduce typing

	* Who would need this? 
		* People who want to plan their outfits
		* young prefessional women who love fashion and time saving
