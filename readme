Project 2 Ideas:

-Shopify API
	-Problem: I spend a lot of time picking an outift each day and for special events.
	-Goal: I would like to make an app that can intergrate with shopify and weather.com
		-The app will list out the day of the week and the weather of the day (ideally you can sleste special event days from a calandar and it will pull up the weather for those days)
		-You will have to upload the clothes you already have and then push them into an API where you can delete or edit those clothes.
		-You can then go through the days of the week and add an outfit to each day - ideally this will have pictures (maybe allow uploading of your own pics or pull from shopify)

	- Who would need this? 
		-People who want to plan their outfits
